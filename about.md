# Custom Textboxes

This mod allows you to spawn <cy>fully customizable popups</c>, at any time! Simply define the textbox in a .json file, and press a button on your keyboard to make it appear.

Currently has support for popups, dialogue boxes, and chests.

Some of the things you can do include:
- Spawn a popup telling you that you're bad at the game
- Spawn a fake shop popup for your icon
- Spawn a chest that gives you 1,000,000 fake orbs
- Spawn dialogue boxes with custom portraits, text sounds, and backgrounds
- Make the Wraith say something quirky
- Chain together textboxes to make an entire visual novel
- <cy>And so much more!</c>

The [full documentation](https://github.com/GDColon/Custom-Textboxes?tab=readme-ov-file#custom-textboxes) can be found on GitHub.

Please report any bugs/issues/crashes you come across, as it's possible I missed a few.

Special thanks to Alphalaneous for helping me with some annoying parts.
